I’m Alondra Esquivel Garcia and I’m running as your next VP of Facilities and Services for Associated Students. Currently, I’m third year double majoring in Political Science and Race & Resistance Studies. As a first generation college student, I have learned that advocating for others and public service is necessary. I’m passionate about helping those in need and getting projects started.\n\\n\\n\n        To ensure success and inclusivity, SF State needs to start to provide more basic need resources.\n        \\n\\n\n        My goals if elected are to:\\n\n        1. Establish an Off-Campus Housing Resource Center.\\n\n        Currently, 17% of students attending SF State are housing insecure. Students need a reliable and safe office that can help them find affordable housing in the Bay Area. \\n\n        2. Expand Multi-Stall Gender Neutral Restrooms.\\n\n        Students who are non-binary need a safe and non-gender confirming multi-stall restrooms that they can use at all hours a day. The single stall restrooms are being used as ADA compliant, family restrooms, and gender neutral. Students fear using these restrooms because there are others who need to use them as well. \\n\n        3. Provide FREE Menstrual Products in EVERY Restroom\\n\n        Not only do females menstruate, but others who are non binary and male menstruate as well. By providing free menstrual products in every restroom, we can ensure we are helping those who menstruate and combating the stigma. \\n\n        \n        \\nI know I can devote my time and effort to get these goals done in the next year.

My name is Andrew Carrillo and I am running to be your next Associated Students President.

Whether you are a first year student just arriving at SFSU or a graduating senior who is ready for the next chapter of life you should feel supported by your student government. One of my main priorities would be to establish a Basic Needs Program that focuses on supporting students who are in need of groceries, hygiene products, and especially provide a centralized hub where students are given information and options for affordable housing in the area. I will work tirelessly to increase funding and resources for AS Programs like Project Connect and the Women's Center so they feel supported by their student government. Lastly, I believe there needs to be greater access to space for student organizations. There needs to be more space on campus where student organizations can gather for meetings, store their organization materials, and host events free of cost.\n\n\\n\\nStudent voices are powerful when we stand united in a common cause.

There are far too many resources that students are not aware of.

I do not have all the solutions nor answers, but I do not hesitate to reach out to people and collect perspectives from students, faculty, and staff of all backgrounds.
