The single stall restrooms are being used as ADA compliant, family restrooms, and gender neutral. Students fear using these restrooms because there are others who need to use them as well. \n\n        3. Provide FREE Menstrual Products in EVERY Restroom\n\n        Not only do females menstruate, but others who are non binary and male menstruate as well. By providing free menstrual products in every restroom, we can ensure we are helping those who menstruate and combating the stigma. \n\n        \n        \nI know I can devote my time and effort to get these goals done in the next year.

I will work tirelessly to increase funding and resources for AS Programs like Project Connect and the Women's Center so they feel supported by their student government.
